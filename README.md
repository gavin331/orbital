APPLLERGY APP


Motivation:

Have you ever wondered what exactly it was in the food you consumed that you were allergic to? Ever needed to avoid food with similar characteristics to prevent an allergic reaction, without actually knowing if you could consume it?  

APPLLERGY aims to reduce that ambiguity, by cross-checking foods that one is allergic to and narrowing down the list of allergens for them. Awareness of what one is allergic to will increase their safety, while preventing them from needing to restrict their food consumption due to confusion of what exactly they are allergic to.


User Stories:

1. As someone who is allergic to certain foods but am unsure of what substance it is specifically, I want to:
(A) Find out what substance it is exactly (the allergen), so that I can avoid foods containing the allergen.
(B) Input an allergen to find out what other possible allergies I may have so that I can be aware of them and avoid foods containing these allergens.
(C) Have a user profile where I can retrieve my possible allergens so that I can keep track of them easily.
(D) Check whether the food I want to consume contains any of the allergens so that I can avoid it if needed.
(E) Enter the symptoms I am experiencing so that I can find out if I am experiencing an allergic reaction, and if so, gauge the severity of symptoms so that I can decide the appropriate course of action.

2. As someone who is the caretaker or friend of a person who has food allergies, I want to:
(A) Access their user profile (with prior app permission) to view their allergens as and when necessary so that I can be aware of their allergens and take necessary precautions.


The 4 features are: find allergen, find foods, check food, and check symptoms. These features are further listed below with a description of their functions, along with illustrations on how they will look and function from the user’s perspective.

1. Find Allergen (Main feature)

This feature is an interface where users can enter multiple foods to find out what allergens they are allergic to. This is done by filtering through the database that is stored in the app’s backend to give the correct output for the users.

The user is able to add all the food that they are allergic to. Then, they can press the find allergen button to find the exact allergens they are allergic to. For example, the user enters peanut and carrot as the food that they are allergic to. After they have pressed the find allergen button, our app filters through the database to get cyclophilin as the common allergen in both of these foods. Finally, users are able to update the local database to store this allergen by pressing the ‘update user profile with results’ button.

2. Find foods (Main feature)

This feature is an interface where users can enter allergens to find out what foods they are potentially allergic to. This is done by filtering through the database that is stored in the app’s backend to give the correct output for the users.

This is similar to the feature above except that the user can add allergens to find the foods that contain these allergens instead. With this information, the user can avoid these foods or seek confirmation from a medical expert. 

3. Check food (Extension feature)

Suppose the user is unsure whether they are allergic to a particular food. Then instead of manually scanning through the food that they are allergic to in the local database stored in their user profile, this feature allows them to easily filter through that database and give the output instead.

4. Check symptoms (Extension feature)

Users who are feeling physically unwell can search the common allergic symptoms corresponding to the food allergy, such as peanut allergy.

The user can use this to determine if they are having an allergic reaction to a food they had just eaten, or whether it is non-allergy-related. Additionally, if they had accidentally eaten a food they were allergic to and wanted to find out the symptoms so they could take countermeasures such as buying medicine, they can simply search that food and thus have a way of predicting the symptoms they are likely to have.
